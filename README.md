Austo Motor Company aims to optimize its marketing campaign by analyzing customer demographic, financial, and preference data. The project identifies key demand patterns across age, income, profession, and car type to improve targeting, enhance customer experience, and boost campaign efficiency.

# Project Summary
This project analyzes customer demographic, financial, and behavioral data to understand car-purchase patterns and strengthen Austo Motor Company's marketing strategy. The dataset is cleaned, validated, and explored through univariate and bivariate analysis to uncover trends across age, gender, profession, marital status, income levels, and loan status.
Insights reveal clear preferences—for example, Sedans are the most purchased, SUVs attract higher-income and older customers, and young males lean toward Hatchbacks. Gender and marital status strongly shape buying behavior, while income and loan obligations influence the ability to buy higher-priced cars.
Key business questions are answered using evidence-backed visualizations, including likelihood of purchase by segment, spending differences by gender, and the impact of personal loans or partner income. The final recommendations offer targeted marketing strategies for each customer segment, highlighting where the company can maximize revenue—especially in the under-penetrated SUV segment.
Overall, the project equips the company with data-driven insights to refine campaigns, improve customer targeting, and optimize sales across car types.
